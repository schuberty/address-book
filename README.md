# address-book
A Java Address Book [project](https://github.com/schuberty/address-book), implementation of [this](http://programmingbydoing.com/a/project-address-book.html).

### It's pretty simple, just run the script if you want:
```
./javaRun.sh -b
./javaRun.sh -r
```

### To finish, one day... maybe...
- [ ] Finish sort functions;
- [ ] Modularize everything better;
- [x] Act as I have finished this work.
